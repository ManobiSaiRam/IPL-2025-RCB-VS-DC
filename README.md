In modern T20 cricket, especially in high-stakes tournaments like the IPL, understanding a batter’s intent is as important as analyzing their strike rate or total runs.
Batting intent reflects how aggressively a player approaches different phases of the game. In this article,
I’ll perform a detailed Batting Intent Analysis with Python using ball-by-ball data from a recent IPL match between RCB and DC in 2025.

OVERVIEW:
We’ll be using ball-by-ball data from a recent IPL match between RCB and DC, which includes details like over number, batter, bowler, runs scored, and wicket events. 
This rich, granular dataset allows us to analyze batting patterns across different phases of the game.

The scope of our analysis is to understand batting intent:
how players approach the game in various situations; by examining strike rates, boundary percentages, 
dot ball rates, and over-wise performance, ultimately uncovering insights that can influence real-time strategy and decision-making.
